F₃Manifesto has launched The Manifest—a curated gallery of the most direct ways to advance self sovereignty & the global decentralised fabrication renaissance through web3, cc0, NFTs, web3 fashion, DAOs, and the open metaverse. 

It’s personally hand selected by Emma-Jane MacKinnon-Lee and includes a mix of NFT content currently live across various marketplaces and platforms. 
Over time, The Manifest will become more digitally immersive and be mapped to it’s very own 3D environment, enabling anyone to engage directly in this ambient metaversal experience. 

Forked from Little Link repo.
